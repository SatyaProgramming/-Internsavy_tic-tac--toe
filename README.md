# -Internsavy_tic-tac--toe
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in Java, using Java Swing and JFrame for creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

How to Play
The game starts with two players as active members. A one-print board is displayed on the screen which shows 9 boxes arranged in a 3x3 grid. The first player chooses either X or O for any one of the boxes. Then the second player enters the opposite choice. The game continues with players taking turns to mark their chosen box until one of them successfully forms a line either diagonally or straight. The first player to achieve this wins the game.
